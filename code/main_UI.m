function varargout = main_UI(varargin)
% MAIN_UI MATLAB code for main_UI.fig
%      MAIN_UI, by itself, creates a new MAIN_UI or raises the existing
%      singleton*.
%
%      H = MAIN_UI returns the handle to a new MAIN_UI or the handle to
%      the existing singleton*.
%
%      MAIN_UI('CALLBACK',hObject,eventData,handles,...) calls the local
%      function named CALLBACK in MAIN_UI.M with the given input arguments.
%
%      MAIN_UI('Property','Value',...) creates a new MAIN_UI or raises
%      the existing singleton*.  Starting from the left, property value pairs are
%      applied to the GUI before main_UI_OpeningFcn gets called.  An
%      unrecognized property name or invalid value makes property application
%      stop.  All inputs are passed to main_UI_OpeningFcn via varargin.

%      *See GUI Options on GUIDE's Tools menu.  Choose "GUI allows only one
%      instance to run (singleton)".
